Robot Diagnostic
################

.. warning::
  The Robot Diagnostic Module (RDM) is currently in **experimental** phase. 3Laws is actively working on expanding and maturing its capabilities.

The Supervisor's RDM is a tool for monitoring the health and safety of various critical robot sub-systems. It is designed to work in tandem with the Supervisor's Run-time Assurance Module (RAM).

As explained :doc:`here <runtime_assurance>`, the RAM relies on various critical robot sub-systems to perform collision avoidance and safety functions. The fault Management part of the RAM is able to detect obvious faults in these sub-systems, like timeouts or corrupted messages,
but it is not able to detect more subtle issues that may arise like inconsistent localization or a faulty sensor. The RDM fills this gap by providing a more thorough and holistic monitoring of critical components to ensure collision-free behavior.

.. warning::
  At the moment, the diagnostic performed by the RDM is not used by the RAM's Fault Management system. The user is repsonible for deciding how to use the information provided by the RDM.


Configuration
==============
In order for the RDM to perform its analysis, it must be fed data about the system. The Control Panel allow the user to configure some extra parameters specific to the RDM in addition with the one already used by the RAM (Run-time Assurance Module).


Metric Modules
==============

The RDM is composed of a set of **metric modules** each of which responsible for analyzing a specific aspect of the robot's health. Each module then streams a set of **metrics**.

.. important::
  Please refer to the :ref:`reference_ros_topics` page for the list of ROS topics where these metrics are published.

.. note::
  The RDM is designed to be modular and extensible. For more information on what other modules and metrics 3Laws can offer, please `Contact 3Laws`_.

The following modules are currently available:

Clock Health
------------

A properly functioning robot should have consistent clocks across all its components. The Clock Health module monitors the synchronization between `system clock <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock>`_ of the computer the Supervisor is running on and an `NTP server <https://www.ntppool.org/>`_. Inconsistent clocks can lead to a variety of issues, including inaccurate, improper timeout and communication detection by the RAM's Fault Management system.

This module publishes the following metrics:

- **clock_health_utc**: The offset between the system clock and the NTP server in seconds. The important fields of the associated message are:

  - **has_utc**: A boolean indicating if the NTP server time is available.

  - **utc_time**: The latest time returned by the NTP in nanoseconds since 1970.

  - **rtc_time**: The latest time returned by the System Clock in nanoseconds since 1970.

  - **offset_from_utc**: The offset between the NTP server and the System Clock in nanoseconds.

Odometry Consistency
--------------------

The Odometry Consistency module is responsible for monitoring the consistency between the robot's odometries and the robot's localization. Inconsistencies between the two is a sign of a problem in the robot's and can lead to collisions.

The RAM (Run-time Assurance Module) relies on a quantitative understanding of the robot's physical behavior and control capabilities (i.e. a `Dynamical Model of the system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system>`_) to make decisions about the appropriate collision avoidance strategy. The Dynamic Consistency module is responsible for monitoring the consistency between the system's Dynamical Model and the observed system behavior. Inconsistencies between the two implies the RAM may not be able to make accurate decisions regarding when to intervene and might lead to collisions.

.. important::
  The process covariance matrix used for the statical analysis is currently the identity matrix.


Node Health

Typical autonomy stacks are composed of **multiple nodes**, each responsible for a specific task. The Node Health module monitors the health of these nodes by checking if they are running and if they are publishing data properly. This module is useful for detecting issues like node crashes or communication loses between nodes. This is critical for nodes like Localization and Perception that are central to the RAM's proper operation.

A node is defined by the set of topics it publishes. The Node Health module monitors the health of the nodes by checking if the topics are being published and if the data is consistent with the expected values.

Near obstructions are detected when the rays are below the minimum range configured, far obstructions are detected when the rays are beyond the maximum range configured, and middle obstructions are detected in between.
