## 1.2.0 (19th August 2024)

Diagnostic and Visualization tools added!

### Fixed

- Remove plot flickering that could appear due to variable update rate
- Fix ROS1 subscriber in control panel
- Fixed actuator signal used by RDM which was wrong when RAM was active.

### Added

- Supervisor logs are now published over ROS
- RDM can now trigger RAM faults based on some metrics
- RAM faults can now be triggered externally via ROS topic
- Can now load mesh for all the formats supported by [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/doc/Fileformats.md) library

#### Control Panel:
Configuration:
- License expiration and detail available
- Odometry consistency
- Dynamic consistency
- System heath (CPU load, RAM load and Read/Write rate)

Operation:
- Generic Logs journal with level selection
- Filter compute time
- Minimap with safety margin visualization
- RAM enable/disable button

Diagnostic:
- Odometry consistency plots and status timeline
- System health plots
- Dynamic consistency plots

Misc:
- Stop button on plots to stop the moving time frame

#### Robot Diagnostic Module

- Odometry consistency metric

#### Runtime Assurance Module

- Added option for simple downsampling of laserscan data

### Changed

- Copilot status is replaced by RDM and RAM status in operation tab
- The behavior preference for the RAM has been simplified, now you don't have to choose between slowing down or turning, it will pick based on commanded velocities
- Dynamic consistency metric module is now based on integration instead of numerical differentiation. Makes for more intuitive metric values
