## Supervisor installation

### Interactive Package installation

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3LawsRobotics/3laws/master/install.sh)
```

### Specific package

You can add arguments after the command to specify the wanted ros and ubuntu version, the desired CPU architecture and non interactive arguments like Always Yes and Force.

- `-a <ARCH [amd64, arm64]>`
- `-v <UBUNTU_DISTRO [18.04, 20.04, 22.04]>`
- `-r <ROS_DISTRO [iron, humble, galactic, foxy, noetic]>`
- `-f <Force even if versions doesn't match>`
- `-y <Always yes>`

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3LawsRobotics/3laws/master/install.sh) [-hyf] [-r <ROS_DISTRO>] [-a <ARCH>] [-v <UBUNTU_VERSION>]
```

### Non interactive

Download the package:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3LawsRobotics/3laws/master/install.sh
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

Run it with your arguments:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh [-hyf] [-r <ROS_DISTRO>] [-a <ARCH>] [-v <UBUNTU_VERSION>]
```

if `-yf -r <ROS_DISTRO> -a <ARCH> -v <UBUNTU_VERSION>` specified, the script is non interactive

As an example:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh -yf -r foxy -a arm64 -v 20.04
```
