Robot Diagnostic
################

.. warning::
  The Robot Diagnostic Module (RDM) is currently in **experimental** phase. 3Laws is actively working on expanding and maturing its capabilities.

  :local:



The Supervisor's RDM is a tool for monitoring the health and safety of various critical robot sub-systems. It is designed to work in tandem with the Supervisor's Run-time Assurance Module (RAM).

As explained :doc:`here <runtime_assurance>`, the RAM relies on various critical robot sub-systems to perform collision avoidance and safety functions. The fault Management part of the RAM is able to detect obvious faults in these sub-systems, like timeouts or corrupted messages,
but it is not able to detect more subtle issues that may arise like inconsistent localization or a faulty sensor. The RDM fills this gap by providing a more thorough and holistic monitoring of critical components to ensure collision-free behavior.

.. warning::
  At the moment, the diagnostic performed by the RDM is not used by the RAM's Fault Management system. The user is repsonible for deciding how to use the information provided by the RDM.


Configuration
==============
In order for the RDM to perform its analysis, it must be fed data about the system. At the moment, the RDM only subscribes to data directly required for the RAM and specified via the Control Panel. 3Laws is actively working on enabling more data sources for RDM configured via the Control Panel.


Metric Modules
==============

The RDM is composed of a set of **metric modules** each of which responsible for analyzing a specific aspect of the robot's health. Each module then streams a set of **metrics**.

.. important::
  Please refer to the :ref:`reference_ros_topics` page for the list of ROS topics where these metrics are published.

.. note::
  The RDM is designed to be modular and extensible. For more information on what other modules and metrics 3Laws can offer, please `Contact 3Laws`_.

The following modules are currently available:

Clock Health
------------

A properly functioning robot should have consistent clocks across all its components. The Clock Health module monitors the synchronization between `system clock <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock>`_ of the computer the Supervisor is running on and an `NTP server <https://www.ntppool.org/>`_. Inconsistent clocks can lead to a variety of issues, including inaccurate, improper timeout and communication detection by the RAM's Fault Management system.

This module publishes the following metrics:

- **clock_health_utc**: The offset between the system clock and the NTP server in seconds. The important fields of the associated message are:

  - **has_utc**: A boolean indicating if the NTP server time is available.

  - **utc_time**: The latest time returned by the NTP in nanoseconds since 1970.

  - **rtc_time**: The latest time returned by the System Clock in nanoseconds since 1970.

  - **offset_from_utc**: The offset between the NTP server and the System Clock in nanoseconds.


Dynamic Consistency
----------------------

The RAM (Run-time Assurance Module) relies on a quantitative understanding of the robot's physical behavior and control capabilities (i.e. a `Dynamical Model of the system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system>`_) to make decisions about the appropriate collision avoidance strategy. The Dynamic Consistency module is responsible for monitoring the consistency between the system's Dynamical Model and the observed system behavior. Inconsistencies between the two implies the RAM may not be able to make accurate decisions regarding when to intervene and might lead to collisions.

This module publishes the following metrics:

- **dynamic_consistency**: Consistency between the Dynamical Model of the system and the observed system behavior. The important fields of the associated message are:

  - **state_timeout**: A boolean indicating if the state information has timed out.

  - **input_timeout**: A boolean indicating if the input information has timed out.

  - **input_domain_value**: The signed distance from the current input to the boundary of the input constraints set.

  - **state_domain_value**: The signed distance from the current state to the boundary of the state domain set.

  - **xdot_difference**: The difference vector between the predicted and observed state derivative.

  - **xdot_difference_pdf_value**: The probability density function (pdf) value of the xdot_difference vector.

  - **xdot_difference_pdf_value_normalized**: The normalized pdf value of the xdot_difference vector, i.e. equal to 1 when the xdot_difference vector is null.

  - **xdot_difference_norm_1sigma**: The signed distance from the value of the norm of xdot_difference to the 1sigma level set of the pdf.

  - **xdot_difference_norm_2sigma**: The signed distance from the value of the norm of xdot_difference to the 2sigma level set of the pdf.

  - **xdot_difference_norm_3sigma**: The signed distance from the value of the norm of xdot_difference to the 3sigma level set of the pdf.

  - **system_degradation_probability**: Not available yet.

.. important::
  The process covariance matrix used for the statical analysis is currently the identity matrix.


Node Health
-----------

Typical autonomy stacks are composed of **multiple nodes**, each responsible for a specific task. The Node Health module monitors the health of these nodes by checking if they are running and if they are publishing data properly. This module is useful for detecting issues like node crashes or communication loses between nodes. This is critical for nodes like Localization and Perception that are central to the RAM's proper operation.

A node is defined by the set of topics it publishes. The Node Health module monitors the health of the nodes by checking if the topics are being published and if the data is consistent with the expected values.

The associated metric is published at 1hz, and is an aggregate of the signal data received over that period.

This module publishes the following metrics:

- **node_health**: The health of the nodes in the system. The important fields of the associated message are:

  - **timeout**: A boolean indicating if all the nodes's topics have timed out.

  - **ok**: A boolean indicating that none of the nodes's topics have timed out.

  - **error_code**: An enum indicating the type of error that occurred. The possible values are: **[ok, some_topics_timeout, out_of_bounds, all_topics_timeout]**

    - **timeout**: A boolean indicating if the topic has timed out.

    - **has_timestamp**: A boolean indicating if the topic's data has a non-zero timestamp.

    - **sender_rate**: The average rate at which the topic is being published by the node.

    - **receiver_rate**: The average rate at which the topic is being received by the RDM.

    - **delay**: The average delay between the time the message was sent and the time it was received.


Sensor characterization
------------------------

The Sensor Characterization module is responsible for monitoring the health of the robot's sensors. This module is useful for detecting issues like sensor malfunctions, or calibration issues. The nominal functioning of the robot's sensors is obviously critical for the RAM's proper operation. If the sensors are not functioning properly, the RAM will make decision based on improper assumption on obstacles location and may lead to collisions.

This module publishes the following metrics:

  - **average_std_error**: The standard deviation of all the sensor measurements over a 1 second window.

  - **max_std_error**: The maximum deviation of all the sensor measurements over a 1 second window.

  - **angle_max_error**: The angle at which the maximum deviation occurred.

  - **percent_of_sigma**: Signed distance from the value of the average_std_error to the 1-sigma level set of the pdf.

  - **p_value**: The p-value of the sensor noise consistency test.

  - **reject_model**: A boolean indicating that the sensor noise statistics are not consistent with the observed noise.


.. important::
  Currently, the expected sensor measurement covariance for 2D laserscans is 1m.


Signal Health
