SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

1. SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT

  1.1 3Laws Robotics, Inc. (“3Laws”) provides its software solution designed to improve and enhance the safety and performance of robotics and other automated solutions (collectively, the “Software”) to you (“Customer”) pursuant to this Software License Agreement (the “Agreement”). By entering into a Software order form (or other ordering document) or Software-related agreement with 3Laws (each an “Order Form”) or otherwise registering for, downloading, accessing or using the Software, Customer unconditionally accepts and agrees to all of the terms of this Agreement. By entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity,

  Customer represents that it has the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to the terms of this Agreement, and, accordingly, the term &quot;Customer&quot; shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If Customer does not have such authority, or Customer does notagree to all of the terms of this Agreement, Customer may not use the Software. Each applicable Order Form is subject to and governed by the terms of this Agreement and forms a part hereof.

  1.2 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, 3Laws

    (a) grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license, solely during the Term, to use the Software solely installed on the robotic system(s) identified in the applicable Order Form solely for Customer’s internal business purposes, and

    (b) will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer reasonable support services, through electronic mail, chat or another online mechanism, in accordance with 3Laws’ standard practice.

  1.3 3Laws reserves the right to change or modify portions of this Agreement at any time. If 3Laws does so, it will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date this Agreement was last revised. 3Laws will also notify Customer, either through the Software user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after being posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Software or changes made for legal reasons may become effective immediately. Customer’s continued use of the Software after the date any such changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the new Agreement.

  1.4 From time to time, Customer may be invited to try certain features or functionality of the Software at no charge for a free trial or evaluation period or if such features are not generally available to customers (collectively, “Evaluation Features”). Evaluation Features will be designated as beta, pilot, evaluation, trial, limited release or the like. Evaluation Features are for Customer’s internal evaluation purposes only and not for production use, are not supported, are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, and may be subject to additional terms.

  Unless otherwise stated by 3Laws, any Evaluation Features trial period will expire sixty (60) days from the trial start date. 3Laws may discontinue any Evaluation Features (or Customer’s rights thereto) at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. 3Laws will have no liability for any  harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any Evaluation Features.

2. RESTRICTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

  2.1 Customer will only use the Software as expressly permitted herein and in the applicable Order Form and agrees that it will not (and will not allow any other party to), directly or indirectly: reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas, know-how or algorithms relevant to the Software or any related documentation, algorithms or data; modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Software (except to the extent expressly permitted by 3Laws in writing); use the Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise for the benefit of a third; use the Software in violation of any applicable law or regulation; remove any proprietary notices or labels; or modify, adapt, benchmark or hack the Software, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Software. All Software is Confidential Information of 3Laws and subject to the terms of Section 3.

  2.2 Customer represents, covenants, and warrants that Customer will use the Software only in compliance with 3Laws’ standard published policies and codes of conduct then in effect and all applicable laws and regulations. Customer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless 3Laws against any damages, losses, liabilities, settlements and expenses (including without limitation costs and attorneys’ fees) in connection with any claim or action that arises from an alleged violation of any of the foregoing or otherwise from Customer’s use of Software.

  Although 3Laws has no obligation to monitor Customer’s use of the Software, 3Laws may do so and may prohibit any use of the Software (or disable content or data) it believes may be (or alleged to be) in violation of the foregoing or any other term of this Agreement.

  2.3 Customer acknowledges that the Software

     (i) records and logs certain usage information related to the Software and related robotic systems, and

     (ii) requires license keys from 3Laws in order to function.  Customer shall not disable or tamper with such recording, logging and/or license key functionality in any way and shall provide 3Laws with reasonable access (either direct or remote, at 3Laws’ option) to all systems on which the Software is installed, operated or used for purposes of monitoring or retrieving any such information or license keys and otherwise cooperate with 3Laws’ efforts to obtain and monitor such information and 3Laws license keys.

3. CONFIDENTIALITY; PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

  3.1 Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose business, technical or financial information relating to the Disclosing Party’s business (hereinafter referred to as “Proprietary Information” of the Disclosing Party). Proprietary Information of 3Laws includes all Software and other non-public information regarding features, functionality and performance of the Software. The Receiving Party agrees:

     (i) to take reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information, and

     (ii) not to use (except as expressly permitted herein) or divulge to any third person any such Proprietary Information. The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document

        (a) is or becomes generally available to the public,

        (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party,

        (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party,

        (d) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party or

        (e) is required to be disclosed by law.

  3.2 3Laws shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to

     (a) the Software, and all improvements, enhancements or modifications thereto,

     (b) any software, applications, inventions or other technology developed in connection with any related services or support, and (c) all intellectual property rights relating to any of the foregoing. No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly set forth herein.

  3.3 With respect to any Customer-related data collected by 3Laws in connection with Customer’s use of the Software (“Customer Data”), 3Laws will maintain a security program materially in accordance with industry standards that is designed to

     (i) ensure the security and integrity of Customer Data;

     (ii) protect against threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer Data; and

     (iii) prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data.

  In furtherance of the foregoing, 3Laws will maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of Customer Data that are consistent with industry practices. To the extent that 3Laws processes any Personal Data (as defined in the DPA referenced below) contained in Customer Data that is subject to Data Protection Legislation (as defined in the DPA) in the provision of the Software, the Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) currently available at :ref:`3LawsDataProcessingAddendum` is hereby deemed incorporated herein by reference. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, 3Laws shall have the right collect, aggregate, retain and analyze data and other information relating to the provision, use and performance of various aspects of the Software and related systems and technologies (including, without limitation, Customer Data and data derived therefrom), and 3Laws will be free (during and after the term hereof) to

     (i) use such information and data to improve and enhance the Software and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with the Software and other 3Laws offerings, and

     (ii) disclose such data solely in aggregate or other de-identified form in connection with its business. Further, for clarity, 3Laws owns all statistical data derived from the operation of the Software, including data regarding the configurations, usage metrics, log data and the performance results for the Software, and nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting 3Laws from utilizing any such statistical and usage data to optimize and improve the Software or otherwise in connection with its business.

4. PAYMENT OF FEES

  4.1 Customer will pay 3Laws the then applicable fees forthe Software as described in the relevant Order Form (or in the Software itself, as applicable) in accordance with the terms therein (the “Fees”). All Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable regardless of any early termination of this Agreement.

  If Customer’s use of the Software exceeds any applicable limits set forth on the Order Form or otherwise requires the payment of additional Fees (per the terms of this Agreement or those in the Order Form), Customer shall be billed for such usage and Customer agrees to pay the additional fees in the manner provided herein. 3Laws reserves the right to change the Fees or applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the initial Term (defined below) or then current renewal term, upon thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Customer (which may be sent by email). If Customer believes that 3Laws has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact 3Laws no later than sixty (60) days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to the 3Laws’ customer support department.

  4.2 3Laws may also choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by 3Laws thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of access to the Software. Customer shall be responsible for all sales, use, value-added and any other taxes associated with its Software access, other than U.S. taxes based on 3Laws’ net income.

5. TERM AND TERMINATION

  5.1 Subject to earlier termination as provided below, this Agreement is for the term specified in the Order Form, or, if no term is specified therein, for a period of one (1) year from the date Customer is first granted access to the Software (the “Term”). The Term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Term, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current Term.

  5.2 In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment), if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement and such breach is not cured during the notice period. 3Laws shall also have the right to terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time upon sixty (60) days prior written notice. 3Laws may also reasonably suspend Customer’s and/or any users’ access to Software at any time in its reasonable discretion if it possesses a good faith belief that Customer’s use of the Software may be in violation of this Agreement or otherwise place 3Laws (or its customers or other interests) at risk of harm, damage, loss or liability. Upon termination, Customer’s right to use the Software shall immediately terminate, all outstanding Fees due for the Software for the entire Term (regardless of any early termination) shall immediately become due and payable, Customer shall return (or at 3Laws’ option destroy) all Software, and each party shall return to the other all Proprietary Information. All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, all rights to payment of Fees, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

6. WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMERS

  6.1 3Laws warrants that the Software will conform to the published specifications in all material respects during the Term.  ANY LIABILITY OF 3LAWS WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF UNDER ANY WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY WILL BE LIMITED EXCLUSIVELY TO SOFTWARE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OR, IF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT IS, IN 3LAWS’ OPINION, IMPRACTICAL, TO REFUND OF THE FEES PAID THEREFOR. 3LAWS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DOES IT MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND 3LAWS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  6.2 CUSTOMER SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES:

  CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT CUSTOMER (NOT 3LAWS) IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF ITS ROBOTIC SYSTEMS (AND OTHER OFFERINGS) AND THAT

     (I) THE SOFTWARE IS ONLY DESIGNED TO SERVE AS AN AID IN SUPPORT OF CUSTOMER’S OWN SAFETY POLICIES AND PRACTICES,

     (II) THE SOFTWARE ITSELF CANNOT AND DOES NOT PROTECT INDIVIDUALS FROM HARM OR INJURY,

     (III) THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE OF SPECIFIC RESULTS OR THE SAFETY OF CUSTOMER’S ROBOTIC SYSTEMS, AND

     (IV) 3LAWS SHALL BEAR NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR (AND CUSTOMER SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD 3LAWS HARMLESS AGAINST) ANY DAMAGE, INJURY OR LOSS TO PERSONS, SYSTEMS OR PROPERTY (OR OTHERWISE) ARISING FROM OR ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER’S ROBOTIC SYSTEMS OR BUSINESS.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, 3LAWS AND ITS SUPPLIERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY:

   (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE OR FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF BUSINESS;

   (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES;

   (C) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND 3LAWS’ REASONABLE CONTROL; OR

   (D) FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE FEES RECEIVED BY 3LAWS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT 3LAWS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. GOVERNMENT MATTERS

Customer may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the Software or Software or anything related thereto, or any direct product thereof in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority. As defined in FAR section 2.101, the Software and documentation are “commercial items” and according to DFAR section 252.2277014(a)(1) and (5) are deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation.” Consistent with DFAR section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, any use modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such commercial software or commercial software documentation by the U.S. Government (or any other foreign or domestic governmental entity) will be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

9. MISCELLANEOUS

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with 3Laws’ prior written consent. 3Laws may transfer and assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without consent. Except to the extent the parties have mutually executed and delivered a separate written agreement covering the same 3Laws Software (a “Separate Signed Agreement”), this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and all waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Separate Signed Agreement, the terms of the Separate Signed Agreement shall supersede and control. However, any different or additional terms of any purchase order, confirmation, or similar pre-printed form (other than an Order Form accepted in writing by 3Laws) will have no force or effect. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind to bind 3Laws in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery Software; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

  - all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

  Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file, and with presence of COPYING or LICENSE file in associated directories.

  This model is selected to emphasize that files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party applications, while all other files, in `programs`, `tests` or `examples`, are intended to be used "as is", as part of their intended scenarios, with no intention to support 3rd party integration use cases.

  The Code: GPL
  The source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, with the addition under section 7 of an exception described in the “GCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1” as follows (or see the file COPYING.RUNTIME):


  GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

  Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

  Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

  When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

  0. Definitions.

  A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.

  "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.

  "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.

  "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

  The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.

  A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.

  1. Grant of Additional Permission.

  You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

  2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

  The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.


  Hopefully that text is self-explanatory. If it isn't, you need to speak to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.

  1.2. “Customer Personal Data” means the Personal Data described under Schedule 1 to this DPA.

  1.3. “Data Protection Laws” means all laws and regulations, including laws and regulations of:
    (i) the European Union, the European Economic Area and their member states, Switzerland and the United Kingdom;
    (ii) the United States (including, but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “CCPA”) and other applicable state privacy laws); and
    (iii) any other jurisdiction in which the parties operate, all (i)–(iii) applicable to the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement.

  1.4. “Data Subjects” means the individuals identified in Schedule 1 to this DPA.

  1.5. “EU SCCs” means the Standard Contractual Clauses approved with Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of June 4, 2021 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as amended, supplemented, updated or replaced from time to time.

  1.6. “GDPR” means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 together with any national implementing laws in any member state of the EEA (“EU GDPR”) and the EU GDPR as incorporated into the laws of the United Kingdom (“UK GDPR”).

  1.7. “Personal Data” and “Processing” will each have the meaning given to them in the Data Protection Laws. The term “Personal Data” includes “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” and equivalent terms as such terms may be defined by the Data Protection Laws.

  1.8. “Personal Data Breach” means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to Customer Personal Data.

  1.9. “Processor” means the entity which Processes Personal Data on behalf of the Controller. The term “Processor” includes a “service provider” as that term is defined under the CCPA.

  1.10. “Sell” has the meaning given in the Data Protection Laws.

  1.11. “Service” means the services provided by 3Laws to Customer pursuant to the Agreement.

  1.12. “Share” has the meaning given in the CCPA.

2. Processing of Customer Personal Data

  2.1. Customer is a Controller of Customer Personal Data and 3Laws is a Processor of Customer Personal Data. If Customer is itself acting as a Processor for Customer Personal Data on behalf of a Controller of such data, 3Laws will Process such data as a Sub-Processor to Customer. The details of 3Laws’ Processing of Customer Personal Data are described in Schedule 1 to this DPA.

  2.2. 3Laws will only Process Customer Personal Data as a Processor on behalf of and in accordance with Customer’s prior written instructions, including any instructions provided through Customer’s use of the Service. Customer hereby instructs 3Laws to Process Customer Personal Data to the extent necessary to provide the Service as set forth in the Agreement and this DPA. 3Laws shall not

      (1) retain, use, or disclose Customer Personal Data other than as provided for in the Agreement, as needed to provide the Service, or as otherwise permitted by Data Protection Laws;

      (2) retain, use, or disclose Customer Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship between Customer and 3Laws, including by combining Customer Personal Data with Personal Data 3Laws receives from third parties, other than Customer, except as permitted by the Data Protection Laws; or

      (3) Sell or Share Customer Personal Data. Upon notice to 3Laws, Customer may take reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate 3Laws’ use of Customer Personal Data in violation of this DPA.

  2.3. 3Laws will immediately inform Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction from Customer infringes the Data Protection Laws.
