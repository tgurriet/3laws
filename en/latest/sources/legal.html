The Term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Term, unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current Term.</p>
<p>5.2 In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days‚Äô notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment), if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement and such breach is not cured during the notice period. 3Laws shall also have the right to terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time upon sixty (60) days prior written notice. 3Laws may also reasonably suspend Customer‚Äôs and/or any users‚Äô access to Software at any time in its reasonable discretion if it possesses a good faith belief that Customer‚Äôs use of the Software may be in violation of this Agreement or otherwise place 3Laws (or its customers or other interests) at risk of harm, damage, loss or liability. Upon termination, Customer‚Äôs right to use the Software shall immediately terminate, all outstanding Fees due for the Software for the entire Term (regardless of any early termination) shall immediately become due and payable, Customer shall return (or at 3Laws‚Äô option destroy) all Software, and each party shall return to the other all Proprietary Information. All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, all rights to payment of Fees, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>

Except to the extent the parties have mutually executed and delivered a separate written agreement covering the same 3Laws Software (a ‚ÄúSeparate Signed Agreement‚Äù), this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and all waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Separate Signed Agreement, the terms of the Separate Signed Agreement shall supersede and control. However, any different or additional terms of any purchase order, confirmation, or similar pre-printed form (other than an Order Form accepted in writing by 3Laws) will have no force or effect. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind to bind 3Laws in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys‚Äô fees. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery Software; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>

The source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, with the addition under section 7 of an exception described in the ‚ÄúGCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1‚Äù as follows (or see the file COPYING.RUNTIME):


GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception (&quot;Exception&quot;) is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (&quot;GPLv3&quot;). It applies to a given file (the &quot;Runtime Library&quot;) that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an &quot;Independent Module&quot; if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.

&quot;GCC&quot; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.

&quot;GPL-compatible Software&quot; is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.

&quot;Target Code&quot; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The &quot;Compilation Process&quot; transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is &quot;Eligible&quot; if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.


Hopefully that text is self-explanatory. If it isn&#39;t, you need to speak to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.
